## Long Abstract

Everybody wants to go on the “Big Data” hype cycle, “To do Scale”, to use the coolest tools in the market like Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Cassandra, etc. 

But do they ask themselves is there really a reason for that? 

In the talk we’ll make a brief overview to all of the technologies in the Big Data world nowadays and we’ll talk about the problems that really emerge when you’d like to enter the great world of Big Data handling. 
Showing you the Hadoop ecosystem and Apache Spark and all of the distributed tools leading the market today, will give you all a notion of what will be the real costs entering that world. 
Promise that I’ll share some stories from the trenches :) 
(And about the “pool” thing...I don’t really know how to swim)
