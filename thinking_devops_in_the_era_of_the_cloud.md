## Long Abstract

The lines between Development and Operations people have gotten blurry and lots of skills needs to be held by both sides.
In the talk we'll talk about all of the considerations that are needed to be taken when creating a development and production environment, mentioning Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment and the Buzzword "DevOps", also talking about some real implementations in the industry.
Of course how can we leave out the real enabler of the whole deal, 
"The Cloud", Giving us a tool set that makes life much easier when implementing all of these practices.

Let me know if you need anything else.
