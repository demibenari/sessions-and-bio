## Long Abstract

After running developer communities over the past 5 years, meeting a lot of great people and learning a lot of things 
about the Israeli Hi-Tech ecosystem, I’ll share all that I’ve learned about what it actually means to create what is 
called a “Community”. The value that you as a community lead can give to the people in it and the things that you can 
gain as a geek out of it. You’ll be surprised to learn how easy and hard it can be at the same time.   
I’ll tell about the steps that I’ve taken in this journey, what in my opinion might kill the concept of 
“Developer Community”, by the end of the talk you'll have as many tools as possible for you to be able to create a 
community of your own.
