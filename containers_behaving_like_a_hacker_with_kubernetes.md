then you come to a point when you need to serve your data on the web,  
of course you need your back office systems support too right?  
Which startup didn’t get to a point that it just didn’t scale anymore?   
In the talk we’ll tell the story of evolving a functioning system at Panorays,  
A solution compiled out of all of the beating parts of a production system leveraging containers and an awesome orchestration
