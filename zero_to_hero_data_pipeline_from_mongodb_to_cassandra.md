## Short Abstract (370 chars)

MongoDB is a great NoSQL database, it’s very flexible and easy to use,
but would it handle massive Read / Write throughput? actually, what happens when you need to scale everything out and easily?
We will lay out the reasons and the steps of migrating our data pipeline to Apache Cassandra in a short period without having any prior knowledge.
We’ll list our lessons learned as well.
